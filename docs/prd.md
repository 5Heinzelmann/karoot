Design System:
1. **Color Scheme**: Use a vibrant color scheme with orange as the dominant color. Complement it with green for the carrot leaves and earthy tones for a natural look.
2. **Illustrative Elements**: Utilize playful illustrations of carrots in various shapes and sizes. These can be used as icons for different categories or buttons.
3. **Animations**: Integrate simple animations, such as a carrot growing or the sudden sprouting of carrot leaves for correct answers. This adds fun and vibrancy to the app.
4. **Typography**: Choose a rounded and friendly font that reflects the organic and playful nature of the theme.
5. **Background Patterns**: Design the background with a subtle pattern of stylized carrots that doesnâ€™t interfere with the user experience but subtly integrates the theme into the design.
6. **Transition Accents**: Use animations during transitions between questions or when displaying results, such as carrots growing or being lifted out of earth cubes.
